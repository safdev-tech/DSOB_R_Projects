San Francisco Bicycle Racks Installation Analysis Steps
===========================================

1. INITIAL SETUP AND DATA PREPARATION
-----------------------------------
a) Environment Setup:
   - Set Project as working directory
   - Installed and loaded required packages (tidyverse, lubridate, corrplot, forecast, kableExtra, RSQLite, leaflet, DT)
   - Configured RMarkdown settings (echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)

b) Data Loading:
   - Imported 'Bicycle_Parking_Racks_20241211.csv'
   - Initial data inspection (structure, missing values, data types)
   - Basic data cleaning and validation

2. DATA PREPROCESSING
-------------------
a) Data Cleaning:
   - Converted PLACEMENT to factor
   - Handled missing values in INSTALL_MO
   - Extracted coordinates from shape column
   - Removed records with missing INSTALL_YR

b) Feature Engineering:
   - Created INSTALL_DATE from INSTALL_YR and INSTALL_MO
   - Formatted date columns appropriately
   - Selected and organized relevant columns

3. SPATIAL ANALYSIS
-----------------
a) Interactive Map Creation:
   - Initialized leaflet map
   - Added base tiles
   - Plotted bicycle rack locations with popup information such as address, racks, spaces, installation year

4. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
-----------------------
a) Basic Statistics:
   - Calculated total number of racks and spaces
   - Summarized by location
   - Analyzed placement types

b) Distribution Analysis:
   - Analyzed rack distribution by neighborhood
   - Studied placement type patterns
   - Examined installation trends

5. TEMPORAL ANALYSIS
------------------
a) Time-based Patterns:
   - Analyzed yearly installation trends
   - Studied monthly patterns
   - Identified seasonal variations

b) Growth Analysis:
   - Calculated cumulative installations
   - Analyzed year-over-year growth
   - Identified peak installation periods

6. CORRELATION ANALYSIS
---------------------
a) Variable Relationships:
   - Created correlation matrix
   - Generated correlation plot
   - Analyzed relationships between variables

7. PREDICTIVE MODELING
--------------------
a) Time Series Analysis:
   - Prepared time series data
   - Fitted ARIMA model
   - Generated 5-year forecast

8. VISUALIZATION AND REPORTING
---------------------------
a) Create Visualizations:
   - Generated summary plots
   - Created interactive tables
   - Prepared relevant visualizations

9. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------
a) Key Findings:
   - Summarized spatial distribution
   - Highlighted temporal trends
   - Identified key patterns

b) Recommendations: shared a few recommendations based on data insights.
   - Address underserved areas
   - Optimize installation scheduling
   - Plan maintenance strategy

10. DATABASE CREATION
------------------
SQLite Setup:
   - Created database structure
   - Defined tables (bike_racks, locations)
   - Imported processed data.
